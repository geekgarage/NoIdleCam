# NoIdleCam

NoIdleCam is a simple yet effective FiveM script allowing players to disable the on foot and vehicle idle camera animations.

  
Players can toggle this on or off in chat and have their preferences saved in the KVS. It will be remembered between game sessions and on any server that uses this resource.

Watch Twitch or YouTube streams on in-game TV screens or possibly during RP scenarios, without annoyingly drifting off into the clouds.


# Installing:

1. Add to your `resources` folder or `[Scripts]` folder

2. Add `start NoIdleCam` to your `server.cfg`. 

**The resource must be named NoIdleCam for the kvs to work.**

# Toggle ON/OFF

In chat type `/idlecamon` to turn idle cam on, and `/idlecamoff` to turn idle cam off.

In chat type `/idlemoveon` to turn idle PED movement on, and `/idlemoveoff` to turn idle PED movement off.
